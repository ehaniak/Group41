    "\n",
    "    Diabetes is a disease in which the human body is no longer able to control the delicate balance of sugar in the bloodstream, which can have serious implications. It is split up into three main types, each with their own causes and risk factors. Type 1 diabetes happens when the pancreas no longer produces insulin, a protein that will  decrease the amount of glucose (sugar) in the blood; while the cause of type 1 diabetes isn’t yet known, there is some indication that there might be a significant hereditary component. In type 2 diabetes the body becomes resistant to its own insulin and while the cause is still mostly unknown, excess body weight, high blood pressure, genetics, and age are all factors that contribute. Gestational diabetes is similar to type 2 diabetes, the main difference being that pregnancy hormones cause its onset(1).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    We seek to explore the following question: Can we determine if a woman has diabetes based on predictors such as blood glucose levels, blood pressure, number of pregnancies, insulin levels, BMI, age, skin thickness, and genetics (called diabetes pedigree function)? To answer this question, we use data collected by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The particular data set surveyed women over the age of 21 of Pima Indian heritage(2).\n",

    "\n",
    "    We expect to find, based on our exploratory data, that (predictors) are the best predictors of diabetes in women of Pima Indian descent. We will further test these indicators during the construction of the predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The impact of this is that a robust predictive model can be constructed from our chosen data set, which can be employed to achieve early prediction of diabetes. \n",
    "\n",
    "    If the model proves to be accurate, it can be trained on various new datasets and different demographics of testing data, to become more accurate to more ethnic/hereditary backgrounds in women, with the goal of being a universally accepted and accurate model for diabetes prediction in women. \n",
